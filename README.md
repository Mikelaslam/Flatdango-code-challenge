# Project tittle: Flatdango-code-challenge

## Introduction

In this code challenge, we are going to develop a Movie theatre app that allows users to view and purchase movie tickets from the app.

## Project set up

First of all we create a new project folder and thereafter create a private Github repository. 
Clone the repository to the new project folder and navigate to it via the terminal. We begin by creating a README.md, index.js, index.html, and a db.json files using touch.
Open the repository in VS code by typing code(space). .
Now we start working on the code.
